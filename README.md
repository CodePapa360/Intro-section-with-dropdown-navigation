<!-- Project brief -->
<p>
This repository contains my solution to the Frontend Mentor challenge "Intro section with dropdown navigation". The challenge was to build a responsive intro section with dropdown navigation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The solution is a modern intro section that adapts to different screen sizes. It is sure to impress visitors with its clean design and smooth animations.
